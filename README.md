## Project Description: 
The "Tower Defense Game about zombies" is an exciting strategy game developed on the Unity platform. In this game, the player must defend their base from hordes of zombies using three types of defensive structures. Each of these structures is designed to combat a specific type of zombie. Players can strategically place defensive towers to maximize their effectiveness and prevent zombies from breaching the base. The game's graphics are crafted in a dark style, conveying the atmosphere of a zombie apocalypse, while the intuitive interface allows players to quickly get accustomed and immerse themselves in the gameplay.

The game features three types of attacking zombies: regular, invisible, and armored. Regular zombies are standard opponents that attack in large numbers. Invisible zombies are harder to detect and require special defensive structures to reveal them. Armored zombies have increased defense, making them more resilient to attacks and requiring the player to develop thoughtful strategies to eliminate them and use certain tower to kill. The variety of enemies and defensive structures makes the game dynamic and engaging, forcing players to constantly adapt and find new tactical solutions to protect their base.
